## COSC110 Programming Assignment 2

## About
> The busstop program was developed following a request from the Mayor of codetown,
> to develop a program that can be used to address the towns school bus over-crowding issues.
> The program will be used as a tool to determine which bus routes will benefit most from an addtional bus.


## System Requirements
>  Linux- Ubuntu 16.04 to 17.10, or Windows 7 to 10, with 2GB RAM (4GB preferable)

## Installation
> The *pt2.tgz* contains this *readme.md* file, *main.py* and *data.py* 
> Copy this file (*pt2.tgz*) to an empty folder on the system and run the following command line.
> tar -zxf pt2.tgz
> This will extract the contents of *pt2.tgz* (*readme.md*, *main.py* and *data.py*) to the directory.

## Executing the program
> At the command prompt, enter the following command.
> python3 main.py

## FAQ Inputs
# The input prompts the user to:
1. List provided by the Mayor of Codetown contains the number of bus routes.
2. Values entered by data inputer cannot be greater than the number of routes contained with the list provided by the Mayor.
3. The data inputer enters the number of routes that can have an extra bus.

## Results
> Data is analysed and produces the following result.
- Input data is verified, 
- The routes with highest number of *unhappy* passegers are given higher priority.
- Program outputs a list of routes that should have an extra bus allocated to it.
