Let's break down the regular expression `r'^\d+(?:\s*,\s*\d+){%d}$' % (expected_values_per_line - 1)` step by step:

1. `r`: The `r` at the beginning of the string denotes a raw string in Python, which means that backslashes are treated as literal characters and not escape characters.

2. `^`: This asserts the start of the string.

3. `\d+`: This matches one or more digits (0-9).

4. `(?: ... )`: This is a non-capturing group, which allows you to group parts of the expression without capturing the result. It's used here to group the comma and digit parts.

5. `\s*`: This matches zero or more whitespace characters (spaces or tabs).

6. `,\s*`: This matches a comma followed by zero or more whitespace characters.

7. `\d+`: This matches one or more digits (0-9) again.

8. `{%d}`: This is a placeholder for the expected number of occurrences of the non-capturing group. The `%d` will be replaced with the actual number using string formatting. `(?:\s*,\s*\d+){%d}` means that the non-capturing group should appear exactly `expected_values_per_line - 1` times.

9. `$`: This asserts the end of the string.

So, the regular expression is designed to match lines that consist of a series of digits separated by commas and spaces, and the pattern should repeat exactly `expected_values_per_line - 1` times. This is used to validate the format of each line in the text file, ensuring that it adheres to the expected structure.

For example, if `expected_values_per_line` is 3, the regular expression will match lines like:
- `123, 456, 789`
- `42, 56, 78`

And it will not match lines like:
- `1, 2, 3, 4` (too many values)
- `12, abc, 34` (non-numeric value)
- `12, 34` (too few values)

Remember to adjust the regular expression according to your specific needs and desired format.
